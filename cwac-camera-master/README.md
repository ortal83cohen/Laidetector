This library suffers from some
[fundamental problems](http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/12/01/my-mistakes-cwac-camera.html).
New projects should look elsewhere, and existing projects should plan
on migrating to something else.

Options include:

- Various other [open source camera libraries for Android](http://android-arsenal.com/tag/141)
- [CWAC-Cam2](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-cam2), the author's second attempt at a camera library
- using the Android SDK APIs (`Camera` and `android.hardware.camera2.*`) directly

If you wish to continue exploring this library, [read on](README-original.markdown).
